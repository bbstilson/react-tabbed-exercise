#React Tabbed Exercise

This component was created to test the knowledge of a user. There are two main states for the component: Active and Review.

While active, i.e., the first time through, the user is presented with a question, and 5 options. The user has 2 tries to get the correct answer. The first time the user guesses the incorrect answer, the feedback tells the user to try again. On the second failed attempt, the correct tab is highlighted, and the feedback tells the user why that answer is the correct answer.

After completing all questions, the exercise switches to a 'review' mode. In this mode, the user can freely navigate through all the questions. The options will show the correct answer, and the feedback will show the reason.
